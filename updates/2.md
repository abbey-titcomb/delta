### #2

Dear community,

Itâ€™s been a few months since our [last update](/updates/1.html). Since
February, weâ€™ve been heads down working on assembling the oscoin core team,
drafting our technical paper, and researching incentivization mechanisms
for the sustainable funding of open-source.

In terms of hiring, weâ€™re happy to say that the following people are joining
the team:

* [Tyler Neely]: Author of [sled] and previously at Mesosphere, Tumblr
and Tendermint, Tyler is helping us with our consensus protocol and testing
infrastructure and brings experience building distributed systems at scale.

* [Julian Arni]: Co-author of [servant] and previously at Tweag I/O,
Julian is working on protocol semantics and chain design and brings lots
of Haskell experience to the table.

[servant]: https://github.com/haskell-servant

* [Onur Akpolat]: Previously at Localytics, which acquired his
company [Tapglue], Onur will be working on company operations and strategy
and free us up to focus on research and development. Onur has been in the crypto
space for some time and runs a crypto related [podcast] in German.

* [Julien Donck]: Previously at SoundCloud and Gidsy, Julien is joining as
a designer focused on user experience. He will ensure we build the protocol
from the ground up with the end user in mind.

As for the protocol, weâ€™ve been busy experimenting and prototyping different
architectures that fit our problem domain. Weâ€™ve taken inspiration from a
variety of projects including [Plasma], [RaiBlocks] and [Dfinity], as well as
interesting ideas such as [categorical patch theory], [BLS signatures]
and [causal consistency] models.

[categorical patch theory]: https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3903
[causal consistency]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_consistency
[BLS signatures]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boneh%E2%80%93Lynn%E2%80%93Shacham

Besides decentralization, developer experience is our foremost constraint and
consideration when evaluating different architectures and consensus protocols.
We believe we have found a promising solution we are excited to share in the
coming months, along with our paper. This puts us on track for a code release
by the end of the year.

On the incentivization side, weâ€™re tapped into the work being done around
[token curated registries] and the development of [crypto-economic primitives].
Our current focus here is on finding reliable mechanisms that incentivize users
to protect the commons rather than exploit it. The work of [Elinor Ostrom]
around [common-pool resources] has been particularly insightful when drawing
parallels between physical resources and digital goods.

**New social channels** ðŸ˜¸

While weâ€™ve been quietly working on all of the above, weâ€™ve also made some
progress on our social channels. You can now find us on Telegram:
[t.me/oscoin](http://t.me/oscoin) and on twitter: [@oscoin]. We are also
staying at Full Node in Berlin until June, so if you're around, come say
hello!

Lastly, some of our team members will be speaking at the following events:

* [Token Summit, NY]: Ele will be talking about misconceptions around
open-source sustainability.
* [Token Engineering Global Gathering, NY]: Ele will be attending the first meetup in New York.
* [RustFest, Paris]: Tyler will be presenting some of his work around
property testing distributed systems - an approach we are taking in developing
oscoin.
* [The Future of Software Development, Reykjavik]: Alexis will be talking about ...
software development.
