Dear community,

Today, we're announcing the first release of our technical [whitepaper][],

<center style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-bottom: 2em;">
Open Source Coin</br/>
Trust and Sustainability in Open Source Communities
</center>

It's been a long time coming, but after many iterations we're ready to share it with the world.
The paper is geared towards the technically-minded, but we've tried our best to keep it clear,
concise and approachable. Grab your copy [here][whitepaper], and let us know on [twitter][] or
via [email][] or [irc][][^1] what you think.

Alongside the paper, we've also put up an [FAQ][] which we will be updating
regularly - so please check there first if you have any question or concern.

Our focus now shifts towards our *public testnet* which we plan to launch in Q3 2019.
More on this in the next few months.

The oscoin team,

*March 21st, 2019*
