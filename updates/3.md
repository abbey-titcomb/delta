### #3

Dear community,

It’s been some time since our last update, but your patience will be rewarded
with news on all things open source coin. [Radicle][radicle], our P2P
collaboration language was [announced], and today we’re releasing a manuscript
detailing its formal semantics. We’ve also hired some great people, worked on
our branding, and made progress on several key research and operational goals.

### Brand Design

While open source developers will ultimately give the network its character,
we’ve given ourselves some simple brand guidelines to ensure our design
choices are transparent and intentional early on, while keeping space
open for the community to color the project themselves.

Along with our updated branding, we’ve completed a light refresh of our website.

And, we wave a new logo, designed by [Ben Pieratt](http://pieratt.com/):

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 1em">
  <img width="300" src="http://oscoin.io/img/opensourcecoin-logo-wide.svg"/>
</div>

Moving forward, we’ll also be consistent with our use of the term 'open source
coin' when referring to the network’s native currency.

### People Updates

We’re excited to have several new people joining the team.

* [Kim Altintop]: Based in Berlin, Kim has been a software engineer for two
decades. He previously led the Data Engineering team at SoundCloud and worked
at Wire and Formation on their Haskell codebases. He also has a grey beard and
contributes to OSS in small batches.

* [James Haydon]: Based in London, James is the co-author of radicle. He has a
Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Oxford and worked as a Postdoc at
Seoul National University. He was previously at Tweag.

* [Sam Hart]: Based in New York, Sam is a researcher and publisher. He has a
background in computational biology and has consulted independently on the
design of several crypto-networks. He recently co-organized the Internet
Archive’s Decentralized Web Summit[^1] and will be joining us to work on
strategy, communications, and our ongoing research around community governance
and mechanism design.

A couple of other talented individuals are also lending us a hand:

* [Ange Royall-Kahin]: Based in Berlin, Ange is currently project managing some
of our diversity initiatives and is helping with operations across the board.
She is currently splitting her time between the Norwegian Refugee Council[^2] and
open source coin. She previously worked at Google as an analyst, and was the
Chief of Staff at WATTx.

### Technology Updates

On the engineering side, our recent work has been focused on *radicle*.  We
recently published our first technical paper describing radicle, as well
as an explanation of where it fits in the greater ecosystem.

* [Annoucement](/radicle.html)

Julien has been working on a DApp with web interface for working graphically
with your codebase, including an updated revision flow process and a UI for
interacting with the radicle ecosystem.

### Research and Other Updates

Ele has been continuing his research on crypto-network governance mechanisms
and has outlined the key design principles for the network’s governance, to be
shared with all of you by the end of the year in a separate post.

In addition, together with Onur, they have conducted an extensive review of
salient monetary policy literature over the past several months and started
drafting a framework for open source coin’s monetary supply schedule. Their
focus is now moving to the design of the treasury allocation mechanism.

Finally, Onur has been preparing the incorporation documents for establishing a
non-profit structure that will support a continued research and education
programs after network launch.

### Upcoming Events

If you happen to be Berlin for Web3 Summit, Ele will speaking about all things
open source coin. Please say hello if you’re in attendance!

* [Web3 Summit](https://web3summit.com/). Berlin, October 24th.
