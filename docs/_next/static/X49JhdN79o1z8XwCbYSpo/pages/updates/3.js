When hearing the term, what pops into your head? It\u2019s likely to be the image of a small blue bird or white \u201cf\u201d on a deep blue background. While social media networks may have seized the term somewhat, in its essence a social network is a network of interconnected humans, online or offline.

A network is a graph, meaning there are entities (nodes) which have connections between them (edges). A graph can be directed or undirected, which means a connection goes one-way or both ways. To illustrate this, Sarah referred to the way users interact on Twitter, where one person follows another and that person does not need to follow back (directed graph), and compared it with how users interact on a platform like Facebook, where \u201cfriending\u201d an individual requires consent by both individuals (undirected graph)."),r("div",{className:"img_wrapper"},r("img",{src:"https://emilywoods.me/assets/images/social_p2p/graph_direction.png"})),r("p",null,"Sarah then continued by describing a couple of specific types of networks: ",r("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network"},"small world")," and ",r("a",{href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network"},"scale-free"),". In a small world graph, some nodes are \u201chubs\u201d meaning that they have a higher number of connections than others. As a result of having a number of highly connected nodes, these small world networks can provide shorter paths between nodes. Sarah likened this to having an extroverted person in the network: someone with a lot of friends and who does a lot of the social heavy-lifting, who as a consequence, will reduce the number of connections between other individuals. For ease of understanding, Sarah suggested a lattice as the opposite of a small world graph, given that each node has an evenly distributed number of neighbours, ie. connections."),r("div",{className:"img_wrapper"},r("img",{src:"https://emilywoods.me/assets/images/social_p2p/small_world.png"})),r("p",null,"A scale-free network, can also be referred to as a power-law network, given that this type of network asymptotically follows a power-law distribution. This describes the relationship between the number of nodes and the number of connections a node will have, and demonstrates the fraction of nodes which are likely to have a particular degree of connectivity. A characteristic of scale-free networks, it is that it can be relatively common for nodes to have a number of connections, which exceeds the average number of connections i.e. a small number of well- connected nodes may dominate the network and result in a centralised structure. Social networks can be scale-free."),r("div",{className:"img_wrapper"},r("img",{src:"https://emilywoods.me/assets/images/social_p2p/scale_free.png"})),r("p",null,"In summary, social networks are just another type of graph, where the nodes are people and the edges are the means by which they connect.

For example, the PGP web of trust and key-signing parties can be considered a form of social network. At a key-signing party, participants sign each others\u2019 keys, which acknowledges this person is who they say they are (via government issued documentation or otherwise), to extend the web of trust. The party itself follows a specific protocol. One of the concepts which comes out of PGP is a strong set, referring to the biggest collection of connected keys. Any two keys within this strong set have a path of connections between them and are part of the global web of trust. However it is possible that isolated islands form, separate from this strong set.

Private messages are encrypted and sent through the people you\u2019re connected to, but can only be decrypted with your intended recipient\u2019s PGP key! One of the neat things about Scuttlebutt is that it is local-first! The story goes that this is because many of the developers and original creators of Scuttlebutt spend a lot of time on boats, and naturally still wanted to be able to connect to their friends. (This is also good to know, since I, too, have had many, many fantasy conversations about beginning a nomadic life on a boat and/or van in recent years).
