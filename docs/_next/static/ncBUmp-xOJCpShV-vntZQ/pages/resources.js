Beyond techo-centric perspectives, P2P can also mean "person to person" and describes a social process to scale up small-group dynamics into resilient, transnational networks. How can Peer to Peer systems help us reimagine our economics and politics.

However, as the usage of the web expanded beyond academia, the IPv4 addresses ran out. Among many ad hoc solutions to address the lack of IPv4 addresses was a system called Network Address Translation (NAT), which is a system where computers in a private network behind one internet facing router are assigned reusable private IP addresses. Even though IPv6 has been introduced, it hasn&apos;t taken off as anticipated by its supporters and the IPv4 + NAT solution still dominates today. Now, the inherent assumptions in the NAT makes it hard to run P2P applications, which act as both clients and servers of data. In this session, we will explore what NAT is, the different types of NAT, what the network topology for various NATs are and the challenges of discovering peers who are behind the NAT."],contact:["M: ram@leastauthority.com",l("br",null),"W: ",l("a",{href:"https://mastodon.radio/@vu3rdd"},"https://mastodon.radio/@vu3rdd")],materials:["Lecture material: ",l("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16WDiJuTQ7mGn3aqjbzjem4eXiVf5pVGU/view"},"slides")," and ",l("a",{href:"https://rkrishnan.org/talks/accessp2p/talk.html"},"summary")],additional:["Additional resources: ",l("ul",{className:"list"},l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/CSG/staff/bocek/extern/theses/BA-Jonas-Wagner.pdf"},"UDP Hole Punching in TomP2P for NAT Traversal")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/p2pnat.pdf"},"Peer-to-Peer Communication Across Network Address Translators")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5128"},"State of P2P over NAT, RFC 5128")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3489"},"STUN, RFC 3489")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2663"},"NAT Terminology, RFC 2663")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4787"},"UDP NAT traversal, RFC 4787")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382"},"TCP NAT traversal, RFC 5382")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245"},"ICE, RFC 5245")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc793"},"TCP, RFC 793")),l("li",null,l("a",{href:"https://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/chacs/sites/www.nrl.navy.mil.itd.chacs/files/pdfs/Dingledine%20etal2004.pdf"},'Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router" Paper')))]})),l("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhNSC_McKJo",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:!0}),l("h3",null,"Mechanism Design - ",l("a",{href:"/lecturers"},"Ele Diakomichalis")),l("p",null,"In this lecture we will provide an introduction to auction and mechanism design as well as a survey of the most relevant topics at the intersection of computer science and economics.
