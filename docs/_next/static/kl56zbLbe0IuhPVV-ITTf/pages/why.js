P2P systems like "Blockchain," "Web3.0," and "decentralized systems" have dominated news and conversations for the last few years. But P2P systems have existed for decades, in many shapes and forms. Starting with Usenet (a worldwide distributed discussion system available on computers) in 1979, this kind of peer-to-peer resource exchange was popularized by Napster and file sharing in 1999. Today, we see P2P technologies challenging centralized web services, P2P philosophies subverting business models and governance structures, and P2P culture demanding greater support of "the commons," like free and open source software.'),o("h3",null,"AccessP2P: An introduction to the technical stack and community behind peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies"),o("p",null,"While a few examples of peer-to-peer technologies have dominated the news, there seem to be few resources for getting an overview of the P2P technology stack and community involved. We believe this creates unnecessary challenges for individuals to get involved - and as P2P technologies gain traction, it becomes more and more important that we get the right people building the technologies. We created AccessP2P in order to build an open-sourced, publicly-accessible library of materials for learning about fundamental P2P concepts. By bringing together members of the P2P community, we will explore many technical topics at a high level in an effort to give early-in-career developers the knowledge and network opportunities they need to better explore issues and careers in the P2P space.

For those who aren't part of the first cohort, we are committed to making the resources we create publicly accessible. Since this is the first time we're providing this kind of programming, we are aware that we might not get everything right.
