However, as the usage of the web expanded beyond academia, the IPv4 addresses ran out. Among many ad hoc solutions to address the lack of IPv4 addresses was a system called Network Address Translation (NAT), which is a system where computers in a private network behind one internet facing router are assigned reusable private IP addresses. Even though IPv6 has been introduced, it has not taken off as anticipated by its supporters and the IPv4 + NAT solution still dominates today. Now, the inherent assumptions in the NAT makes it hard to run P2P applications, which act as both clients and servers of data. In this session, we will explore what NAT is, the different types of NAT, what the network topology for various NATs are and the challenges of discovering peers who are behind the NAT."],contact:["W: ",l("a",{href:"https://mastodon.radio/@vu3rdd"},"https://mastodon.radio/@vu3rdd")],materials:["Lecture material: ",l("a",{href:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/16WDiJuTQ7mGn3aqjbzjem4eXiVf5pVGU/view"},"slides")," and ",l("a",{href:"https://rkrishnan.org/talks/accessp2p/talk.html"},"summary")]})),l("iframe",{width:"560",height:"315",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhNSC_McKJo",frameborder:"0",allow:"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture",allowfullscreen:!0}),l("br",null),l("div",{className:"resources"},l(n,{title:["Social P2P - ",l("a",{href:"/lecturers"},"Sarah Friend")],description:['How would you host a static website on a P2P network?
