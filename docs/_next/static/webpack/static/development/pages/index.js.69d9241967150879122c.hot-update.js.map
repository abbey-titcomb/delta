Regardless of your level of technical skills, AccessP2P will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of P2P technology and process.\n        </h3>\n        <h3>\n          The Program\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n        During the month of November, the AccessP2P Program brought together a cohort of 10 students for weekly lectures from local P2P experts - at no cost to students. From Bitcoin to Scuttlebutt, from governance to smart contracts, the program highlighted a spectrum of P2P theories, concepts, and technologies. A total of ten lectures [LINK TO RESOURCES PAGE] were hosted by local projects and companies and gave the cohort the opportunity to grow their network within the Berlin P2P community.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <h3>\n          The Curriculum\n        </h3>\n        <br />\n        <Table />\n        <br />\n        <p>\n        Read lecture descriptions <a href = \"/resources\">here</a>.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          Who should apply?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          We expect AccessP2P applicants to have some programming knowledge - whether it be self-taught or otherwise - but they are not required to be a traditional &apos;developer&apos;. We hope to host a cohort with varying levels of technical skills and different backgrounds. As such, we are committed to creating a safe space to answer questions and provide additional resources so that concepts presented are accessible to anybody interested in diving into P2P technology.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>Applications closed 22 September 2019.
