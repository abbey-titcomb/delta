As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all. <br /><br />This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as what we define as acceptable behavior. <br /><br /> We invite all those who participate in our events to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.<br /><br /></p>\n\n          <h3>Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship</h3>\n          <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community. <br /><br />Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. <br /><br /> If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.<br /><br /></p>\n\n          <h3>Expected Behavior</h3>\n          <ul className=\"list\">\n            <li> Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.</li>\n            <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your communication and actions.</li>\n            <li>Feedback is welcomed and should be constructive, legible, and actionable. We are all learning.</li>\n            <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict, assuming good faith in the other community members.</li>\n            <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.</li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <h3>Acceptable Behavior</h3>\n          <p>Communication should always come from a place of respect for other contributors. Bullying, vulgarity, intolerance, or alienation based on gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics do not meet our standard for respect and will not be tolerated. <br /><br /> Comments that denigrate an individualâ€™s identity create a climate of fear that drives contributors to exit, and diminishing this community does not serve our shared purpose.<br /><br /></p>\n\n          <h3>If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior</h3>\n          <p>Should you feel certain behaviour constitutes a transgression of our community standards or that community members have been placed at risk, or have other concerns, please email ange@monadic.xyz. Monadic is committed to its responsibility for addressing these concerns and will use their discretion to secure the health of the AccessP2P community.</p>\n\n\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Page>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Content\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAOA;AACA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
