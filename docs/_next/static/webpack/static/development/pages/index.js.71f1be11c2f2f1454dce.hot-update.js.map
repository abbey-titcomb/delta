From Bitcoin to Scuttlebutt, from governance to smart contracts, the program highlighted a spectrum of P2P theories, concepts, and technologies. A total of <a href = \"/resources\">ten lectures</a>  were hosted by local projects and companies and gave the cohort the opportunity to grow their network within the Berlin P2P community.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <h3>\n          The Curriculum\n        </h3>\n        <br />\n        <Table />\n        <br />\n        <p>\n        View lecture descriptions, videos, and materials <a href = \"/resources\">here</a>.\n        </p>\n        <h3>\n          Who is AccessP2P for?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          While AccessP2P participants have some programming knowledge - whether it be self-taught or otherwise - not all of them are traditional 'developers'.
