From Bitcoin to Scuttlebutt, from governance to smart contracts, the program will highlight a spectrum of P2P theories, concepts, and technologies.\n\n        Lectures will be hosted by local projects and companies, giving the cohort the opportunity to grow their network within the Berlin P2P community.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <ul className=\"specs\">\n          <li>\n            <h4>\n              &#9889; 8+ lectures from experts in the peer-to-peer space\n            </h4>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <h4>\n              &#9889; Access to mentorship, career, and network opportunities\n            </h4>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <h4>\n              &#9889; No cost to participants\n            </h4>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n        <br />\n        <h3>\n          The Curriculum\n        </h3>\n        <br />\n        <Table />\n        <h3>\n          Who should apply?\n        </h3>\n        <p>\n          We expect AccessP2P applicants to have some programming knowledge - whether it be self-taught or otherwise - but they are not required to be a traditional &apos;developer&apos;.
