class="answer">AccessP2P is an open education program for those interested in learning more about peer-to-peer technologies, processes, and projects - while developing their network in Berlin. While it is comprised of a set of 8 core lectures that took place on-site in Berlin during November, all of the materials and videos from the lectures have been open sourced and published on this website. AccessP2P’s goal is to make the P2P space (blockchain and beyond!) more accessible and diverse.</p><p class="question">Who organizes AccessP2P?</p><p class="answer">AccessP2P is organized by a few individuals at <a href="https://monadic.xyz"> Monadic</a>. However, the initiative wouldn’t be possible without the commitment of <a href="http://accessp2p.xyz/lecturers">individuals</a> - the majority of whom are contributors to the Berlin P2P community - who are creating original, accessible materials for the program. If you have questions about organization, logistics, or content, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:hello@accessp2p.xyz">us</a>.</p><p class="question">Why does AccessP2P exist?</p><p class="answer">The organizers saw a few issues in the quickly growing and changing P2P space: 1) The community suffers from similar diversity concerns that the general tech industry faces 2) There are few introductory materials to support those who are curious about P2P and want to transition into the space. Therefore, we created AccessP2P to build a library of introductory materials and host a small cohort to take advantage of a supportive peer group and the growing network of Berlin-based mentors and experts. While we believe that this is a good starting point for increasing the diversity of those entering the P2P space, we are aware that we might not get everything right. We are look forward to working with our first cohort of students to share future iterations of this program.</p><p class="question">When will the next cohort take place?</p><p class="answer">We haven’t determined yet in what form AccessP2P will continue. We’ll be speaking with our first cohort and set of lecturers to understand how to evolve, adapt, and improve the program for the future. If you are interested in participating, <a href="https://accessp2p.typeform.com/to/J4ahyX">sign up</a> for our updates or <a href="https://twitter.com/accessp2p">follow us</a> on Twitter.</p><p class="question">What are the requirements to be a student?</p><p class="answer">For the AccessP2P cohort, we prioritized open-minded individuals who are 1) curious about P2P and 2) have some programming knowledge (even if limited). We also target and prioritze outreach to communities that support identities underrepresented in the P2P space. Our main goal for AccessP2P is to increase the diversity of this community.</p><p class="question">Do I have to be an engineer to be part of AccessP2P?</p><p class="answer">Not at all. While we require that students have some knowledge of programming, you don’t need to be a developer or engineer to participate. The first student cohort was composed of all levels of technical ability.</p><p class="question">How much time does the course take? And is there homework?</p><p class="answer">The core lecturers took place across 8 evenings (Mondays and Wednesdays) during the month of November. Each evening lasted about 2 hours (until 20:30-21:00). Outside of the lecture time itself, some lecturers gave an article or their slides as preparatory reading - but these were limited and not required (only for additional benefit). As for homework, after each lecture, some lecturers provided “additional resources and further reading,” allowing students and remote users to pursue further, selective self-study.</p><p class="question">Can individuals keep their job AND be part of the student cohort?</p><p class="answer">Definitely. We created AccessP2P with accessibility in mind. That’s why we limited the program to two lectures per week, only in the evenings. This way, those with personal or professional obligations could join us.</p><p class="question">Does it cost anything to participate in the AccessP2P program?</p><p class="answer">AccessP2P is completely free for participants. The lecture materials and videos are also publicly available online for other communities to use and adapt.</p><p class="question">Do AccessP2P students need to live in Berlin?</p><p class="answer">For the first iteration of AccessP2P, we had an in-person, Berlin-based student cohort so participants could take advantage of a small group of supportive peers as well as a mentor network. However, as all materials from the program are made available and open-sourced on this site, we encourage global use of AccessP2P’s <a href="/resources">resources</a>.</p><p class="question">Where did the lectures take place?</p><p class="answer">Most of the lectures took place in project/company offices around Gorlitzer Park.</p><p class="question">Outside the 8 core lectures, are there other opportunities for program participants?</p><p class="answer">Yes. We created two additional, inspirational lecture opportunities that illustrate how people are using P2P, why it is important, and the problems we could consider solving with P2P systems and technologies. These opportunities were optional to program participants. Furthermore, we are looking for ways to keep the first AccessP2P cohort engaged with the next iterations of the program and the P2P community more generally.</p><p class="question">Can I participate remotely?</p><p class="answer">While we won’t be live-streaming the lectures, we will be putting lecture videos and materials on this website (on the <a href="http://accessp2p.xyz/resources"> Resources</a> page), as soon as the lecture takes place.</p><p class="question">Will the material be provided online at some point?</p><p class="answer">Yes! You can find lecture videos and materials on our <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page.</p><p class="question">How can I stay in touch with the development of the program?</p><p class="answer">Even if you aren’t part of the cohort, we’d love to keep you up-to-date on the program evolution, resources from our lectures, etc. The best way to do this is by <a href="https://accessp2p.typeform.com/to/J4ahyX">signing up</a> for our updates, referencing our <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page, or <a href="https://twitter.com/accessp2p">following us</a> on Twitter.</p><p class="question">When are applications for AccessP2P due and when will I know if I’m part of the student cohort?</p><p class="answer">Applications for the first AccessP2P cohort are due September 22, 2019. Applicants will be notified by October 7 as to whether they’ve been selected for the program.</p></div><div><p class="question">Where can I learn more about AccessP2P?</p><p class="answer">If you can’t find answers to your questions via this FAQ or elsewhere on this website, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:hello@accessp2p.xyz">us</a>.</p><p class="question">Do you deliver a certificate upon completion of the program?</p><p class="answer">While we don&#x27;t currently have plans to issue a certificate, this doesn’t mean it couldn&#x27;t be something driven by the desire and initiatives of the student cohort. That being said, it&#x27;s important to recognize that we aren&#x27;t an accredited institution. And a certificate won&#x27;t recognize some of the other value-add of the program: a mentor network and a group of supportive peers.</p><p class="question">Do you have a Code of Conduct?</p><p class="answer">Yes we do!
