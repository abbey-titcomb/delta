But what about the people behind those nodes in the network and their affective and physical needs? Beyond techo-centric perspectives, P2P can also mean "person to person" and describes a social process to scale up small-group dynamics into resilient, transnational networks. How can Peer to Peer systems help us reimagine our economics and politics.  As a commons-advocate and project lead for the Commons Transition project, Stacco will discuss the wider implications of P2P.']}

            description={['The web was originally designed to be decentralized so every participating computer (often referred to as an endpoint or a node), each assigned an IP address, could participate meaningfully in the network. However, as the usage of the web expanded beyond academia, the IPv4 addresses ran out. Among many ad hoc solutions to address the lack of IPv4 addresses was a system called Network Address Translation (NAT), which is a system where computers in a private network behind one internet facing router are assigned reusable private IP addresses. Even though IPv6 has been introduced, it has not taken off as anticipated by its supporters and the IPv4 + NAT solution still dominates today. Now, the inherent assumptions in the NAT makes it hard to run P2P applications, which act as both clients and servers of data. In this session, we will explore what NAT is, the different types of NAT, what the network topology for various NATs are and the challenges of discovering peers who are behind the NAT.']}

        <h3>Security - <a href= "/lecturers">Liz Steininger</a></h3>
        <p>
        The topic of security encompasses many elements of our technology functioning in a way that keeps us safe from threats. In this lecture, we will go through the exercise of threat modeling and talk about the common attacks to P2P networks. We will also explore how to reduce the risk of these threats to build and maintain P2P systems that meet their goals of confidentiality, integrity and reliability of the data they provide.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <h3>Primitives - <a href= "/lecturers">Lucas Vogelsang</a></h3>
        <p>
        P2P software often relies on cryptography to validate behavior of other nodes, keep networks in sync and provide consensus. This session gives a broad overview starting with the very basic primitives such as hash functions, signature schemes but also more complex constructions such as zero knowledge proofs.

        <h3>Decentralized Governance - <a href= "/lecturers">Kei Kreutler</a> and <a href= "/lecturers">Pat Rawson</a></h3>
        <p>
        From its first use, the phrase Decentralized Autonomous Organization conjured an array of potentialities, including legal representation and management for natural systems to imaginaries of independent Skynet-like entities. Kei‚Äôs lecture will include a brief working definition of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), a history of their implementations to date in relation to decentralized organizing, and an overview of the dxDAO, a project initialized by Gnosis in early 2019 for community governance of software protocols. Some speculations on the future of DAOs will, of course, be interspersed throughout. Pat's lecture will discuss the emergence of collaborative networks and new institutional design patterns. In addition, Pat will present the DAOstack project, a blockchain governance platform that aims to facilitate the creation of superscalable cooperative structures.
