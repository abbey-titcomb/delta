### Software Engineer, Web

* **Location**: Berlin
* **Commitment**: Full-time
* **Compensation**: 100'000 EUR/year + equity[^1]
* **Paid vacation**: 30 days

At Monadic, the team behind oscoin, we're putting together our product team and
looking for a few experienced engineers who are well versed in web technologies
and have an eye for design. We'd like to speak to people who are empathetic,
humble, passionate about their work and strive for excellence.

Currently, our efforts are focused on building the reference implementation of
[oscoin](http://oscoin.io), an open-source protocol and network for
decentralized code hosting and collaboration which aims to make open-source
development more sustainable. But to really make this shine, we hope to build a
beautiful user experience on the web.

We invest in people primarly, not technologies: if you are a seasoned software
engineer but lack experience with some of the tools, technologies or languages
we use, we can get you up to speed.

You will have to be an excellent communicator, both in oral and written form.
You will have to be a fast learner and care deeply about product, usability and
user experience.

At Monadic, the culture is the people we hire. We have core tenets which you
will learn about and help shape, but these revolve principally around how we
treat each other and what standards we try to meet when working together.

If you'd like to apply, please send us an email at <jobs@monadic.xyz> with
your résumé and links to or samples of work you've done; we especially value
open-source contributions.

[^1]: The salary is equal for all employees, including founders, regardless of
  location. We believe in having a level playing field for everyone and in
  keeping the team small. Equity is negotiable based on experience.
